# slimUG
slightly modified Ubuntu Gnome

sli(ghtly) m(odified) U(buntu) G(nome) is a personal project based on sli(ghtly) m(odified) Advaita theme and a modified White shell theme.

The addition of black icons for dash-to-dock defines a clean white, document style interface.

Adwaita theme has been augmented with original circle-based window control icons and a collection of beautiful white background walpapers.
